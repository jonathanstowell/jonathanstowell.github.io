Hi, I've decided it may be time to begin writing blog articles to share some of my knowledge and things I'm working on with the community. It's still early days and this is more of a placeholder if anything... I've got this site setup using github pages combined with Jekyll! Much easier than my last attempt at this with Wordpress! Stay tuned for future posts. All this site has to offer as of now is an [about me](/about) page! Here you can view my background and the types of projects I've worked on to date.
