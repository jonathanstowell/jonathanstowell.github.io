Most features start with an idea... "my industry knowledge makes me feel this would be a good feature", or "maybe we should build this", sometimes even "a significant portion of our customer base are asking for this feature". How do we go from this high level discussion to delivering something end users actually use? How many of us have deployed features just to see them not being used? How many of us have actually taken the time after noticing they're not being used to discover why?

## The Pipeline

Concept -> High Level Refinement -> High Level Estimate -> User Stories -> Refinement -> What makes this a success? -> Backlog -> Prioritisation -> Sprint Planning -> Sprint Cycle -> Deployment -> Demo -> Monitoring Success Metrics -> Done || Why isn't this a Success -> User Feedback -> Decision (Rework || Remove) 

## The Concept

How many engineers have experienced a meeting where an initial idea for a feature or more likely an epic is proposed... then within 30 seconds are being asked how long it would take to build? It tends to be a difficult question to answer at such an early stage, specially without the details.

This is why this high level concept should be handed over to an analyst, to take away, debate with peers and dissect into blocks which add more detail. Now armed with this detail we can go back to the stakeholders and talk through the concept in more detail. 

This gives the stakeholders an opportunity at a very early stage to correct, refine or even throw out the assumptions that have been made so far. Also, as we have more detail it leads to a more in depth discussion around the concept and all parties leave the session with a greater understanding of what needs to be built. It may potentially be useful to repeat this cycle a number of times depending on how all the parties feel at the end of the session.

At this point in the process, it's fair to say not everyone needs to be involved, perhaps one analyst, one more experienced engineer, one UI engineer the blend will vary from company to company. The idea at this stage is to get just enough detail, not all the detail but enough to get more understanding without spending too much. We want to get the concept to a point where you can gain a High Level Estimate (HLE).

## High Level Estimate (HLE)

With enough detail around the concept it's time to get the wider team involved with providing an estimate. Some companies tend to run a process where an individual is responsible for estimates, most likely a Development Manager or a Lead Developer. 

However, I tend to find that if you want buy in from the team and the individuals who are going to be delivering the feature, it makes sense to work as a team to provide a sensible HLE. I've found that an individual or someone who is being told "it has to be done in x" that sets unrealistic delivery timetables, will not tend to hold the respect of the team, they will not have any buy-in to the delivery nor be willing to stretch to deliver. They will try to deliver but ultimately know its a unrealistic deadline... so why would they go above and beyond to deliver? Empowering the team gives them buy-in, it gives them power and it gives them attachment to what they're working on. This ultimately in my eyes leads to motivation.

The great thing about doing this with the team so early on, before starting to get into user stories and other things that come later in the pipeline, is that it starts to get them thinking about what maybe coming up in the not so distant future. They might pop to make a coffee, have a 5 minute think about the problem whilst staring blindly at the kettle to boil, that might lead to some great ideas no one else has had!

HLE's are always going to be vague and must allow for the uncertainty that comes with software development. T-Shirt Sizing tends to be the best approach I've found throughout various roles.

- S = 1 - 5 days
- M = 1 - 4 weeks
- L = 1 - 3 months
- XL = 3 months+

Once we get to this stage we can go back to the business/stakeholders and have a conversation around whether this is a viable concept. If the estimate is too high, what can be removed to deliver quicker? Could the concept be broken down into phased deliverables that in their own right deliver value?

It might even be sensible to create a business case around this, what do we see the potential return on delivering this concept being? Does it still make sense to prioritise compared with other concepts?

Phased concept deliverables can be a nice way of taking less risk on a concept investment as it allows for validation before making further investments in the later phases.

I've found at many places I've worked decisions on concepts/features can be made on opinion, gut feel, what would be cool etc etc and are not viewed as investments. I tend to feel this is due to employees time not being treated as a real cost. However, and this shouldn't be a surprise, it is! Every minute, hour, day, months an individual or a team spends working on a concept is a financial cost... 

When we think about finance most investors are looking for the best return for the funds they have available, why would they put money in something that returns 3% if they've got a juicy 6% return elsewhere! 

Why aren't we thinking in the same terminology for software?

Back to the point of the HLE. It's there to allow the business/stakeholders to make an informed decision, now they have more detail and time, as to whether this is still the right thing to do right now. Could we be working on something else that has a better return?

By not diving straight into building/delivering something, we've used less time at a lesser cost, because of this we can build up several concepts to the HLE stage and make more informed/better decisions about what we want to spend time on. Once you have enough of these in the pipe it allows for a greater ability to pivot if its decided the concept isn't feasible during the next stage of the pipeline... which will be discussed in a later post!
